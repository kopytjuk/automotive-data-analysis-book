# What is this book about

The automotive and robotics industries are both a rapidly evolving fields, with technological advancements and increasing consumer demands driving innovation and growth.
In recent years, the use of data analysis has become increasingly important in the industry, allowing players to make well-grounded decisions
 and gain a competitive edge in both function and safety.

This book focuses on the theoretical foundations of data analysis in both industries, exploring key concepts such as interpolation,
coordinate transformations and basic knowledge behind the state-of the art sensor technology. Furthermore, 
you receive a systematic view on processing and combining spatiotemporal- and sensor data from various sources.

With clear language, illustrations, practical examples and references to further resources, 
this book provides a comprehensive overview of how these techniques can be applied to analyse and
 optimize various aspects of the assisted- or automated driving.

Whether you are a data analyst, engineer, or robotics professional, 
this book provides an essential guide to the theoretical foundations of data analysis in the automotive industry space. 
By understanding these key concepts and techniques, you can drive and guide innovation in this dynamic and exciting field.

This book tries to fulfill the following goals:

- Introduce a common terminology across data analysis tasks in robotics and/or automotive space
- Provide foundational knowledge to work with various sensors used for various driving tasks
- Showcase state-of-the art python libraries for particular topics
