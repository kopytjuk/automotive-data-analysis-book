# What is this book about

The automotive and robotics industries are both a rapidly evolving fields, with technological advancements and increasing consumer demands driving innovation and growth. Furthermore, the methods, concepts and tools used across those industries cover multiple scientific and engineering domains: Physics, signal processing, machine learning,
geodesy, numerical theory robotics, control theory etc. This variety can pose a significant challenge for data scientists which have zero or little background in this topics.

This online book tries to summarize the most essential concepts
used for data analysis in both the automotive and robotics industry. The concepts covered here, can be applied to logistics, autonomous vehicles, traffic analysis etc.

This book focuses on the theoretical foundations of data analysis in both industries, exploring key concepts such as interpolation,
coordinate transformations and basic knowledge behind the state-of the art sensor technology. Furthermore, 
you receive a systematic view on processing and combining spatiotemporal- map and sensor data from various sources.

With clear language, illustrations, practical examples (in Python) and references to further resources, 
this book provides a comprehensive overview of how these techniques can be applied to analyse and optimize various aspects of your domain. By understanding these key concepts and techniques, you can drive and guide innovation in this dynamic and exciting field.

This book tries to fulfill the following goals:

- Introduce a common terminology and concepts for data science tasks in robotics and/or automotive space in clear, simple language
- Provide a general reference work to refresh the concepts introduces
- Provide foundational knowledge to work with various sensors used for various driving tasks
- Showcase state-of-the art python libraries for particular topics
