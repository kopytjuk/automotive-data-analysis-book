# Interpolation

Interpolation (Latin for *inter* = between and *polire* = smoothing) is an essential technique for processing numerical data in the engineering domain. 
Sensor output recorded over time as time-series usually requires interpolation to reduce the data amount 
or as a first step to combine with other data sources.

Mathematically, given a list of $N$ pairs \\( (x_i, f_i) \ \forall i \in 0 \dots N-1 \\), often generated by an unknown function or process \\(f(x)\\), 
we are interested in the intermediate values of \\( x \\) which are not equal to any of \\( x_i \\). 
Usually, the list is sorted by \\( x_i \\). In case we are interested in values of \\( x < x_0 \\) or \\( x > x_{N-1} \\) we talk about *extrapolation*.

Note, that the argument \\( x \\) can also be time \\( t \\), in that case we speak about temporal interpolation.

There are multiple approaches to interpolate between known data points, which will be listed in the following sections.

## Methods

### Proximity-based

The algorithms in the proximity based method family select the value of the nearest point and does not consider the values of neighboring points at all, yielding a piecewise-constant interpolant around a single point. The algorithm is very simple to implement and is commonly used. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest-neighbor_interpolation)

The proximity can be defined based on the numerical distance to the sample points (nearest-neightbor), or based on the position wrt to sample points.

In some applications however, especially those dealing with time-series, taking the nearest sample means taking values in the future, which is not always suited. Therefore variation forward-fill ``ffill` exist, where \\( f_i \\) is true for all \\( x \in [x_i, x_{i+1}[ \\). 

The opposite, backward-fill, where \\( f_{i+1} \\) is true for all \\( x \in [x_i, x_{i+1}[ \\) is often used for XYZ.
