# Transformation

Traffic is dynamic in its nature: vehicles and motorcycles overtake each other, pedestrians appear behind occluded areas or cyclists change from sidewalks onto the driving lane.

In order to describe those interactions quantitatively in terms of distances, velocities and visibilities, also considering sensor positions and the measurement times, transformations between coordinate systems can become helpful.
